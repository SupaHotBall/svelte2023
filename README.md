# OverView Of Website
Welcome to my JuJutsu Kaisen website, the perfect place for anime lover! My website is all about the jujutsu kaisen, with lots of pictures and videos to look at. 
- First of all, you enter to the main page then you will see a intro of the JuJutsu Kaisen video from youtube and the back ground are blur, onc eyou click on the close button on the top right of the video, then everything will be clear to see.
- Second, hover to the character button that have a hover effect with diff color on it, onc eyou click on it then a huge eye will fade out to your screen, also will isplay 3 of the characters i like the most in this anime, which are Gojo, Ryomen an Kento. Also when u hover your mouse on the character name it will have transition effect which is pretty cool i think.
- Thrid, click either one of the character then you will see some cool animation effect on the left side of the screen, those are Gojo name with English and Japanese. below his name there have some clip videos of Gojo only, also you can click the right button to slide to the right to see more videos of himself. Also if you want to see others character feel free to click on the character button on the top right corner.
- Fourth, click on the photo slider, then u will see some cool images which are displaying in the center of the screen and in the bottom there have some button with auto slide and manual slide to the left and right. There are total 5 cool image on that page.
- Last, the fetching API page, Im doing my best to solve the problem of the width and height of the fetching image. But AT LEAST i got it fetching right :D
